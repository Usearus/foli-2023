## Things to add

---CRITICAL---
-   Change to pages
-   Click to scroll
-   If I add a page scroll to the end
-   Figure out where my linting/formatting went wrong...
-   Setup activeCategory variable to context to be able to access when a template closes.
-   Learn how to do validations (Required name on a sheet, etc.)
-   Sticky survey at bottom
    What do you like, what's missing, what to chat about it?


---LOW PRIORITY---
-   Sidebar with templates pre-chosen based on stage.
-   AddSheetModal missing title count & limitation. (May use context for this)
-   Filter on top of the jobs list, but only for stage.
-   Make pages a sidebar on mobile
-   Animate table row when adding a job
-   Make 14px font default on React-Quill component
-   Add full job sample to onboarding with as many docs that make sense.

-   Spaces
