# Packages

- This file has:
- Styled Components
- Airtable (database)
- React Router
- Auth0
- react-cool-onclickoutside (trigger callback when user clicks outside of target component. Used for my location dropdown. May remove)

## Things to add

---CRITICAL---

- Make trash button work while rest of row is clickable
- Add 'Position Details' sheet for each position
- When an account using Auth0 is created, add a record to Airtable profile base that has the members email address

---LOW PRIORITY---

- Add badges under locations!
- Add multi-fields for location
- Make Profile like the Figma profile page.
- When I click on profile remove active state on nav item
- When I hover over a table row make it clickable
- Move Profile & Logout into nav image
- Get "remote" checkbox value to push to new Job records.
- Edit Preferences Modal content to match content pre-filled. (Should I use something other than placeholder?)
