# Information

- This file has:
- Styled Components
- Airtable for Database
- React Router
- Auth0

## Things to add

---CRITICAL---

- Look into Axios to do async (see what we did for Github User project)
- Fetch airtable after updating the base in all instances (Airtable is currently not reloading)
- Add 'Position Details' sheet for each position
- Click a job to bring user into a single job page (see what we did for Github User project)
- When an account using Auth0 is created, add a record to Airtable profile base that has the members email address

---LOW PRIORITY---

- Move Profile & Logout into nav image
- Get "remote" checkbox value to push to new Job records.
- Edit Preferences Modal content to match content pre-filled. (Should I use something other than placeholder?)

## Post-MVP Features

## Done

- Ability to Add and Delete a job
- Markup conversion in sheets using react-showdown package
- Filter user jobs in table by what is in my account
